      "name": "Column Generation with Dynamic Matrix:\n  Delayed column generation for large-scale LPs:\n  1. **Restricted Master:** Solve LP with subset of columns\n  2. **Pricing:** Use duals \u03c0 to find column with c\u0304_j = c_j - \u03c0'A_j < 0\n     - createVariable() generates and adds promising column\n  3. **Pool Management:** Columns enter \"small\" working matrix from pool\n     - If working matrix too large: compress (remove non-basic columns)\n  4. **Re-optimize:** Solve updated master problem\n  5. **Termination:** No more negative reduced cost columns",
      "math": "Reduced cost pricing:\n  For column j in pool: c\u0304_j = c_j - \u03a3_i \u03c0_i \u00b7 a_ij\n  If c\u0304_j < 0 for minimization: column can improve objective\n  GUB structure: \u03a3_{j\u2208S_k} x_j = 1 adds dual \u03c0_k to pricing",
      "complexity": "Per pricing: O(pool_size \u00b7 column_length) to evaluate all\n  Compression: O(working_matrix_nnz) when triggered\n  Total: O(iterations \u00b7 pricing) + O(simplex_pivots)\n\nColumn generation workflow:\n1. Solve restricted master problem with current columns\n2. Use dual prices to identify promising new columns (pricing subproblem)\n3. Add columns with negative reduced cost via createVariable()\n4. Re-optimize and repeat until no improving columns exist\n\nKey features:\n- Maintains both \"small\" working matrix and full column pool\n- Columns move between pool and working matrix as needed\n- Automatic compression when working matrix gets too large\n- Integrates with GUB structure for efficient handling",
