Each transformation must\npreserve optimal solution recovery.",

Presolve\nsimplifies an LP before solving by applying reversible transformations:\nremoving fixed variables, empty rows/columns, redundant constraints, etc.\n\nThe typical workflow is:\n1. presolvedModel() - create simplified model\n2. Solve the presolved model\n3. postsolve() - recover solution to original model"
