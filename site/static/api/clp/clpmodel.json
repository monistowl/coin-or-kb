  "brief": "Base class for LP/QP models - stores problem data without algorithm logic\n\nClpModel holds the complete representation of a linear or quadratic program:\nconstraint matrix, variable bounds, objective coefficients, and solution vectors.\nThis is the base class inherited by ClpSimplex and ClpInterior - it knows about\nproblem data but nothing about solution algorithms.",
