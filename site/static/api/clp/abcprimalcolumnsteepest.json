After pivot, update only: w_s' = ||B\u207b\u00b9\u00b7a_s||\u00b2, w_j' = max(w_j, w_j_hat\u00b2)\n     where w_j_hat is contribution from pivot column\n  3. Reset all weights to 1 periodically (every ~factorization)\n  Typically 80-90% as effective as full steepest edge at lower cost.",

After pivot where row r leaves:\n  w_j' = w_j - 2\u00b7\u03b1_j\u00b7(a_j^T\u00b7\u03c4) + \u03b1_j\u00b2\u00b7w_s where \u03c4 = (B\u207b\u1d40\u00b7e_r)/\u03b1_r\n  Incoming column: w_s' = 1/\u03b1_r\u00b2 (becomes basic, new row weight)",
