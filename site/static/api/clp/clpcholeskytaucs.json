Symbolic: Build elimination tree, identify supernodes\n  3. Numeric left-looking: For each supernode j:\n     - Assemble: Gather column j from A and previous L updates\n     - Factor: Dense Cholesky on diagonal block\n     - Scatter: Distribute updates to later columns\n  4. Store L in CCS format with supernode structure",
      "math": "Left-looking vs right-looking:\n  Left-looking: L_j computed from A_j and L_{<j} (memory efficient)\n  Right-looking: Updates distributed immediately (more parallelism)\n  TAUCS uses left-looking for lower memory footprint",
      "complexity": "O(nnz(L)\u00b7f\u0304) where f\u0304 = average supernode front size\n  Memory: O(nnz(L)) for factor storage\n  Well-suited for medium-size interior point problems",
