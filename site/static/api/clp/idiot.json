Despite its self-deprecating name (which is copylefted!),\nit serves as an effective \"crash\" procedure to warm-start the simplex method.",

Internal IBM documentation on crash heuristics.\n\nThe algorithm works well on problems where the volume algorithm succeeds,\noften finding better primal solutions, though it produces no dual solution.\nIt's particularly useful for:\n- Getting a starting basis before simplex (crash mode)\n- Homogeneous problems with similar constraint structure\n\nKey methods:\n- crash(): Lightweight initialization (2-5 passes typical)\n- solve(): Full approximate solution (50-100 iterations)\n- crossOver(): Transition to simplex for exact solution"
