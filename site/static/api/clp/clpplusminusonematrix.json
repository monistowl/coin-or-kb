  "brief": "Specialized matrix where all nonzeros are +1 or -1\n\nEfficient storage for constraint matrices where every coefficient is either\n+1 or -1. Common in set partitioning, covering, and assignment problems.\nNo element values are stored - only row indices, with separate start arrays\nfor positive and negative entries in each column.",

      "name": "Plus-Minus-One Matrix Operations:\n  Exploits binary coefficient structure for multiplication-free operations:\n  1. **Storage:** Only row indices stored, no element values\n     - startPositive_[j] to startNegative_[j]-1: rows with +1\n     - startNegative_[j] to startPositive_[j+1]-1: rows with -1\n  2. **Column j unpacking:** Direct index lookup, no multiplication\n  3. **Matrix-vector y = Ax:**\n     For each column j with x_j \u2260 0:\n       For i in +1 region: y[i] += x_j\n       For i in -1 region: y[i] -= x_j\n  4. **Transpose x = A'y:** Similar, accumulate \u00b1y[i] into x[j]",
