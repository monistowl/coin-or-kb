  "brief": "Abstract base class for constraint matrices in Clp\n\nDefines the interface that all matrix types must implement for use with\nClp algorithms. The abstraction allows specialized matrix formats that\nexploit structure (network, GUB, \u00b11 matrices) while providing a uniform\ninterface to the simplex solver.",
