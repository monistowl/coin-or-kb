Mode 3 is default.\n\nWeight update after pivot: uses FTRAN result d = B^{-1}a_j directly.\nSteepest: weight_k := ||d_k||\u00b2 computed from tableau column.\nDevex: weight_k := max(weight_k, (d_k/d_p)\u00b2 * weight_p) for columns in ref set.",
      "math": "Column weight: \u03b3_j = ||B^{-1}a_j||\u00b2 = d_j^T d_j where d_j is FTRAN of a_j.\nNormalized ratio: |c\u0304_j|/\u221a\u03b3_j gives steepest descent direction in primal space.\nDevex approximation: track reference set R, update \u03b3_j \u2248 max over iterations.",
