  "brief": "Cholesky factorization base class for interior point methods\n\nProvides Cholesky factorization of the normal equations matrix A*D*A'\nused in predictor-corrector interior point methods. The factorization\nuses AMD ordering to reduce fill-in.\n\nThe base class provides a simple sparse Cholesky implementation with\nsupernodal dense blocks. Derived classes can interface to more\nsophisticated factorizations (MUMPS, Pardiso, TAUCS, etc.).\n\nKey methods:\n- order(): Compute fill-reducing ordering (AMD by default)\n- symbolic(): Set up sparsity structure of factor\n- factorize(): Numeric factorization of A*D*A'\n- solve(): Solve system using computed factors",

      "name": "Sparse Cholesky Factorization for Interior Point Methods:\nComputes A*D*A' = L*L' where L is lower triangular. Used to solve the\nnormal equations in each IPM iteration. Key algorithmic features:\n1. AMD ordering to minimize fill-in (sparse L has fewer nonzeros)\n2. Symbolic factorization: predict sparsity structure before numeric work\n3. Supernodal blocking: dense submatrices within sparse structure\n4. Row dropping: handle rank deficiency by removing dependent rows",
      "math": "Normal equations: A*D*A' * dy = r where D = X^{-1}*S (diagonal scaling).\nFactorization: LL' = P(ADA')P' where P is permutation from AMD ordering.\nSolution: dy = P' * L'^{-1} * L^{-1} * P * r (forward/back substitution).\nCondition number tracked via choleskyCondition_ for numerical stability.",
      "complexity": "Symbolic: O(nnz(L)) to compute structure.\nNumeric factorization: O(nnz(L)^2 / n) with supernodal, O(n^3) dense worst case.\nForward/backward solve: O(nnz(L)) per iteration.\nWith AMD ordering, nnz(L) << n^2 for sparse problems.",
