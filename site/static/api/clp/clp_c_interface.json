  "brief": "C language interface to Clp solver\n\nPure C API for embedding Clp in C programs or creating language bindings.\nDesign follows OSL V3 conventions for familiarity.\n\nOpaque handles:\n- Clp_Simplex: Pointer to internal ClpSimplex object\n- Clp_Solve: Pointer to ClpSolve options object\n\nNaming convention: C++ method foo() becomes Clp_foo(model, ...)\nwhere model is the first parameter.\n\nKey function groups:\n- Construction: Clp_newModel(), Clp_deleteModel()\n- Problem setup: Clp_loadProblem(), Clp_readMps()\n- Solving: Clp_dual(), Clp_primal(), Clp_initialSolve()\n- Solution access: Clp_getColSolution(), Clp_getRowActivity()\n- Parameters: Clp_setLogLevel(), Clp_setMaximumIterations()\n\nCallback support: clp_callback typedef for user message handling.\n\nThread safety: Each Clp_Simplex is independent; do not share across threads.",
