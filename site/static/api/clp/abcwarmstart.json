Beyond basic/nonbasic status, can store:\n\nType encoding:\n- 0: Standard basis (as CoinWarmStartBasis)\n- 1,2: Plus factor order as shorts/ints (high bit = column)\n- 3,4: Plus compact saved factorization\n- +8: Steepest edge weights stored (as floats)\n\nAlso defines AbcWarmStartOrganizer for managing multiple warm starts\nin tree search (branch and bound) scenarios.\n\nKey features:\n- deleteRows()/deleteColumns(): Maintain valid basis after problem changes\n- createBasis0/12/34(): Create warm starts of different types\n- Support for incremental factorization updates",
