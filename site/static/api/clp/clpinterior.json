      "name": "Interior Point Method (Barrier Method):\nSolves LP by following central path through interior of feasible region.\nMain variant is Mehrotra predictor-corrector:\n1. Affine scaling direction: solve Newton system for complementarity\n2. Centering direction: correct toward central path with adaptive \u03bc\n3. Combined step: predictor + corrector with step length limiting\n4. Update (x, y, s) and reduce barrier parameter \u03bc\n\nPer iteration solves normal equations: (ADA^T)\u0394y = rhs\nwhere D is diagonal scaling matrix from current iterate.\nCholesky factorization of ADA^T is computational bottleneck.\n\nConverges in O(\u221an log(1/\u03b5)) iterations (polynomial complexity).\nEach iteration O(m\u00b2n + m\u00b3) for forming/factoring normal equations.",

Often faster than simplex for very large\nor dense problems.\n\nTwo main variants supported:\n- Predictor-Corrector: Standard Mehrotra-style algorithm\n- PDCO: Primal-Dual Barrier method with regularization\n\nRequires Cholesky factorization for the normal equations A*D*A'.\nMultiple Cholesky backends available (dense, MUMPS, TAUCS, etc.)"
