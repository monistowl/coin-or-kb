It also filters the cuts\naccording to their scores.\n\n**Scoring function:**\nGiven LP solution x*, score S(C) = viol(C) / actv(C) where:\n- viol(C) = violation of cut C by x*\n- actv(C) = number of variables in C with x* > 0\n\n**Admission criterion:**\nA cut enters the pool only if it has the best score for at least\none of its variables. This filters out cuts that are unlikely to\nbe useful (every variable already has a better cut).\n\n**Dominance removal:**\nCut A dominates cut B if A is at least as tight as B for all\nfeasible integer points. Dominated cuts are periodically purged.",
