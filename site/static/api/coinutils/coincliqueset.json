It is an\nextension of class CoinCliqueList.\n\n**Deduplication:**\nUses polynomial rolling hash to detect duplicate cliques.\nCliques are sorted before hashing to ensure canonical form.\nHash collisions resolved via bucket chains with exact comparison.\n\n**Use case:**\nDuring clique enumeration and separation, same clique may be\ngenerated multiple times. This class efficiently filters duplicates.",
