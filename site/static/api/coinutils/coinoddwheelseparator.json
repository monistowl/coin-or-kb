It contains\na lifting module that tries to transform the odd-cycles\ninto odd-wheels.\n\n**Odd-Hole Inequalities:**\nFor an odd cycle C = {v\u2081,...,v\u2082\u2096\u208a\u2081} in the conflict graph:\n\u03a3\u1d62 x\u1d62 \u2264 k is valid (at most k of 2k+1 mutually conflicting vars can be 1)\n\n**Odd-Wheel Extension:**\nIf variable w conflicts with all cycle vertices, strengthen to:\n\u03a3\u1d62 x\u1d62 + x_w \u2264 k (wheel center w tightens the inequality)\n\n**Separation Algorithm:**\nUses shortest path in auxiliary graph where edge weights are\n1 - x_i - x_j. Violated odd holes correspond to negative-cost\nodd-length paths.",
