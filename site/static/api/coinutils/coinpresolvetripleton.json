Substitute y into objective and all constraints containing y\n  3. Eliminate the constraint row and variable y\n  Only applied if substitution doesn't increase total nonzeros",
      "math": "Original: ax + by + cz = d\n  Substitution: y = (d - ax - cz) / b\n  Objective: c_y\u00b7y = c_y\u00b7d/b - (c_y\u00b7a/b)x - (c_y\u00b7c/b)z\n  Postsolve recovers y from optimal (x*, z*)",
