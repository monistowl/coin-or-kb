Solve constraint i for x_j: x_j = (b_i - \u03a3_{k\u2260j} a_ik x_k) / a_ij\n  2. Substitute x_j expression into all other rows containing x_j\n  3. After substitution, x_j becomes column singleton\n  4. Apply implied_free_action to remove x_j and row i\n\n  Fill-in control: only substitute if total nnz doesn't increase too much",
      "math": "Substitution creates fill-in: originally empty positions become nonzero\n  Fill estimate: (nnz(col_j) - 1) \u00d7 (nnz(row_i) - 1) new elements\n  Controlled by fill_level parameter to prevent explosion",
