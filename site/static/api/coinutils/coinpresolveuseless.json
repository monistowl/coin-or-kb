For each constraint, compute implied bounds on variables\n     - If constraint tightens some bound, mark as \"necessary\"\n     - Update working column bounds with tighter values\n  3. After processing all constraints, for non-necessary rows:\n     - Compute row activity bounds: L_i = \u03a3 min{a_ij\u00b7l_j, a_ij\u00b7u_j}\n     - If l_i \u2264 L_i and U_i \u2264 u_i, constraint is redundant\n  4. Remove redundant constraints, save for postsolve",
