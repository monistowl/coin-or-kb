Supports both\nimmediate sorted insertion and batch insertion with deferred sort.\n\n**Batch mode:**\nDuring graph construction, use addNeighborsBuffer() for bulk additions\nwithout maintaining sorted order. Call flush() once construction is\ncomplete to sort all adjacency lists and remove duplicates.\n\n**Sorted mode:**\nUse addNeighbor() for incremental updates to a constructed graph.\nMaintains sorted order via binary search insertion.",
