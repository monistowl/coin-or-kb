  "brief": "Node description holding subproblem-specific data\n\nAlpsNodeDesc holds problem data for a tree node separate from tree\nstructure data. Users inherit this class for application-specific data.\n\n**Design rationale:**\n- AlpsTreeNode: Tree structure (parent, children, status)\n- AlpsNodeDesc: Subproblem data (bounds, constraints, etc.)\n\nThis separation simplifies parallel communication: only the\ndescription needs to be encoded for node transfer.\n\n**Representation modes:**\n- Explicit: Full problem data stored\n- Relative: Differences from parent node",
