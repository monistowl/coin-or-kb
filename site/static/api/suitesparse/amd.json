  "brief": "Approximate Minimum Degree ordering for sparse matrix factorization\n\nAMD computes a fill-reducing permutation P for sparse Cholesky or LU\nfactorization. Given a symmetric matrix A (or A+A' if A is unsymmetric),\nAMD finds P such that P*A*P' has fewer nonzeros in its Cholesky factor\nthan A would.",

Form element e from eliminated node and merge with adjacent elements\n  3. Update approximate degrees for remaining nodes\n  4. Apply aggressive absorption: absorb element e into element f if\n     adj(e) \u2286 adj(f), even when f is not adjacent to current pivot",
