  "brief": "Simple sparse LDL' factorization for symmetric matrices\n\nLDL computes a sparse LDL' factorization of a symmetric matrix A:\n  A = L * D * L'\nwhere L is unit lower triangular and D is diagonal. This factorization\nworks for symmetric indefinite matrices (D may have negative entries).\n\nThe factorization is performed in two phases:\n1. ldl_symbolic: Compute elimination tree and allocate storage\n2. ldl_numeric: Compute numerical values of L and D\n\nTriangular solves (ldl_lsolve, ldl_dsolve, ldl_ltsolve) complete the\nsolution of Ax = b.",
