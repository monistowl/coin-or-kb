      "math": "Intuition for hybrid approach:\n- FM: fast local moves, explores discrete neighborhood\n- QP: smooth objective, can \"jump over\" discrete barriers\n- Alternating: FM finds local minimum \u2192 QP perturbs \u2192 FM refines\n\nThe \"waterdance\" metaphor: like water finding lowest point via\ndifferent flow patterns (discrete drops vs continuous flow).",
