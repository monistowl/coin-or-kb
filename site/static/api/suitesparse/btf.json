  "brief": "Block Triangular Form permutation for sparse matrices\n\nBTF computes permutations to transform a sparse matrix into block upper\ntriangular form (BTF). This decomposes the matrix into independent blocks\nthat can be processed separately, improving efficiency for factorization.\n\nThree main routines:\n- btf_maxtrans: Maximum transversal (zero-free diagonal matching)\n- btf_strongcomp: Strongly connected components (block decomposition)\n- btf_order: Combined BTF ordering (calls both above)",
