CONSTRAINT PROCESSING:\n   - User specifies C[i] = k meaning vertex i in constraint set k\n   - All vertices in set k ordered before any vertex in set k+1\n   - Within each set, AMD heuristic orders vertices freely\n2. AMD ORDERING (per constraint set):\n   - Quotient graph maintains elimination graph implicitly\n   - Select vertex with approximate minimum degree\n   - Eliminate, update quotient graph, absorb indistinguishable vertices\n3. OUTPUT: Permutation P such that P\u00b7A\u00b7P' has reduced fill",
