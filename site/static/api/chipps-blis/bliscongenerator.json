  "brief": "Interface between BLIS and CGL cut generators\n\nWraps a CglCutGenerator with configuration controlling when and how\ncutting planes are generated during branch-and-cut.\n\n**Strategy options (BlisCutStrategy):**\n- None: Cut generator disabled\n- Root: Generate cuts only at root node\n- Auto: BLIS decides based on effectiveness\n- Periodic: Generate every cutGenerationFrequency_ nodes\n\n**Trigger conditions:**\n- normal_: Call in standard cut generation loop\n- atSolution_: Call when integer solution found\n- whenInfeasible_: Call when LP becomes infeasible\n\n**Statistics tracked:**\n- numConsGenerated_/numConsUsed_: Cut effectiveness\n- time_: CPU time spent in generator\n- calls_/noConsCalls_: Call frequency tracking\n\n**Usage:**\n1. Create: BlisConGenerator(model, new CglGomory(), \"Gomory\")\n2. Register: model->addCutGenerator(generator)\n3. BLIS calls generateConstraints() based on strategy",
