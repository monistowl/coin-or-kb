Start with LP relaxation solution\n2. Round each integer variable to nearest integer\n3. Check if resulting solution is feasible\n4. If not, try to fix infeasibilities\n\n**Matrix storage:**\nMaintains both column-major (matrix_) and row-major (matrixByRow_)\nrepresentations for efficient access during rounding.\n\n**seed_:** Random seed for tie-breaking decisions.",
