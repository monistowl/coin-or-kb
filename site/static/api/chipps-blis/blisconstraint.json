  "brief": "Constraint (cut) representation for BLIS branch-and-cut\n\nRepresents a linear constraint (row) that can be added to the LP.\nUsed for both original constraints and generated cutting planes.\n\n**Data members:**\n- size_, indices_, values_: Sparse row representation\n- Bounds inherited from BcpsConstraint (lbHard, ubHard, lbSoft, ubSoft)\n\n**Key methods:**\n- createOsiRowCut(): Convert to OsiRowCut for LP solver\n- violation(): Compute constraint violation for given LP solution\n- hashing(): Compute hash key for duplicate detection\n\n**Usage in branch-and-cut:**\n1. CglCutGenerator produces OsiRowCut objects\n2. Converted to BlisConstraint for storage in pool\n3. Applied to LP via createOsiRowCut() when needed",
