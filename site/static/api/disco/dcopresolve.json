  "brief": "Presolve/preprocessing for MISOCP problems\n\nDcoPresolve extends OsiPresolve to handle conic problems,\napplying reductions before branch-and-bound.\n\n**Supported Operations:**\n- Bound tightening (improve_bounds)\n- Redundant row/column removal (from OsiPresolve)\n- Problem scaling and reformulation\n\n**Two Modes (compile-time):**\n- OA mode (__OA__): Uses OsiSolverInterface\n- Direct mode: Uses OsiConicSolverInterface\n\n**Usage:**\n1. DcoPresolve(origModel) - Initialize with original model\n2. presolve() - Apply reductions, create presolvedModel_\n3. Solve presolved problem\n4. postsolve() - Restore solution to original space",
