  "brief": "Variable representation for MISOCP\n\nDcoVariable represents a decision variable in the optimization problem,\nstoring bounds, integrality type, and branching information.\n\n**Inheritance:** DcoVariable -> BcpsVariable -> BcpsObject -> AlpsKnowledge\n\n**BcpsObject Fields (inherited):**\n- lbHard_/ubHard_: Original bounds\n- lbSoft_/ubSoft_: Current bounds (may be tighter from branching)\n- intType_: Integer ('I'), binary ('B'), or continuous ('C')\n- objectIndex_: Position in model's variable array\n\n**Key Methods:**\n- infeasibility(): Returns integrality violation (for integer variables)\n- createBranchObject(): Create DcoBranchObject for branching on this\n- clone(): Deep copy for node differencing\n\n**Storage:**\nVariables are stored in BcpsModel::variables_ (inherited by DcoModel).\nInteger variable indices are tracked in DcoModel::integerCols_.",
