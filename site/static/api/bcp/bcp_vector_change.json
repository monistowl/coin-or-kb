This is the core of BCP's compact tree storage.\n\n**Storage modes:**\n- Explicit: Full vector stored in _values\n- WrtParent: Delta encoding via:\n  - _del_pos: Positions to delete from parent\n  - _change_pos: Positions to modify after deletions\n  - _values: New values (changes first, then additions)\n\n**Key operations:**\n- update(): Apply delta to reconstruct explicit vector\n- as_change(): Compute delta between two vectors\n- pack/unpack(): Serialization for message passing",
