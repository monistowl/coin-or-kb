  "brief": "Iteration output during restoration phase\n\nRestoIterationOutput provides per-iteration summary output while\nthe algorithm is in restoration phase. It displays metrics for the\nORIGINAL NLP (not the restoration feasibility problem).\n\nOutput format:\n- Iteration number marked with 'r' prefix to indicate restoration\n- Objective value from original NLP\n- Constraint violation (theta) for original constraints\n- Dual infeasibility for original problem\n\nDual output mode:\nIf resto_orig_iteration_output is provided, produces two lines:\n1. Restoration phase problem metrics\n2. Original NLP metrics (using original scaling)\n\nConfiguration:\n- print_info_string_: Whether to print info at end of line\n- inf_pr_output_: What to show in inf_pr column\n- print_frequency_iter_: Iteration print frequency\n- print_frequency_time_: Time-based print frequency",
