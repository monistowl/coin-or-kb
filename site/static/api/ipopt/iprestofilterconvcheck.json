Current point acceptable to original filter\n2. Current point shows sufficient decrease vs original iterate\n3. Constraint violation reduced below tolerance\n\nThe orig_filter_ls_acceptor_ reference is used to query:\n- IsAcceptableToCurrentIterate(): Armijo or \u03b8-type improvement\n- IsAcceptableToCurrentFilter(): Point not dominated by filter\n\nImportant: SetOrigLSAcceptor() must be called before Initialize()\nto establish the link to the original problem's filter.\n\nNote: Uses raw pointer to avoid circular reference with line search.",
