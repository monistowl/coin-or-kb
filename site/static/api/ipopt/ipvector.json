  "brief": "Abstract base class for all vector types in Ipopt\n\nVector is the foundation of Ipopt's linear algebra abstraction.\nProvides BLAS-1 style operations (Copy, Scal, Axpy, Dot, Nrm2, etc.)\nplus IPM-specific operations (AddOneVector, FracToBound, etc.).",

      "name": "Template Method + Abstract Factory Pattern:\n  - Public methods (Axpy, Dot, etc.) delegate to protected *_Impl methods\n  - VectorSpace factory creates compatible vectors of same type\n  - TaggedObject inheritance enables automatic cache invalidation\n  This design allows DenseVector and CompoundVector to share interface\n  while providing type-specific optimized implementations.",
      "math": "IPM-specific operation - FracToBound:\n  \u03b1 = max{\u1fb1 \u2208 (0,1] : x + \u1fb1\u0394x \u2265 (1-\u03c4)x}\n  Computes maximum step length maintaining fraction-to-boundary \u03c4.\n  Critical for ensuring positivity of slack variables in interior-point.\n\nKey design features:\n- Inherits TaggedObject for automatic cache invalidation\n- Uses VectorSpace factory pattern for creating compatible vectors\n- Template Method pattern: public methods call protected *_Impl methods\n- Implementations: DenseVector, CompoundVector\n\nDerived classes override protected *_Impl methods to provide\nactual computation (e.g., CopyImpl, AxpyImpl, DotImpl).",
