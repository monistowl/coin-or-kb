  "brief": "Low-rank Hessian handling via single backsolve (iterative solver friendly)\n\nLowRankSSAugSystemSolver handles LowRankUpdateSymMatrix Hessians\n(from L-BFGS) by augmenting the system rather than using\nSherman-Morrison. This requires only ONE factorization/backsolve.",

L-BFGS gives W = \u03c3I + V\u00b7M\u00b7V^T (compact representation).\n  2. Instead of Sherman-Morrison (k backsolves for rank-k update):\n  3. Augment KKT: J_c_ext = [J_c; V^T], add k extra \"constraint\" rows.\n  4. Extended system: [\u03c3I, J^T, V; J, -D, 0; V^T, 0, M\u207b\u00b9] [\u0394x; y; q] = [r].\n  5. Single factorization of larger (n+m+k) system.\n  6. Advantage: Iterative solvers like GMRES prefer one larger system.",
