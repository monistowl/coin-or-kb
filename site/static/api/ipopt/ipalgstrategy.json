Call InitializeImpl() (subclass-specific hook).\n    3. Return success/failure status.\n  Ensures consistent initialization across all algorithm components.\n  ReducedInitialize() variant for components not requiring full IPM context.",
      "math": "Dependencies injected at runtime:\n  - IpoptNLP: problem definition (f, c, d, bounds, Hessian).\n  - IpoptData: iterate storage (x, s, y, z) and algorithm state.\n  - IpoptCalculatedQuantities: cached derived values (\u2207f, J, residuals).\n  Separation allows testing and alternative problem formulations.",
