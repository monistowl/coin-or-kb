  "brief": "Augmented system solver using GenKKTSolverInterface\n\nGenAugSystemSolver adapts the AugSystemSolver interface to use\nGenKKTSolverInterface, which provides a more generic linear solver\ninterface supporting iterative methods.\n\nThis class:\n- Extracts raw Number* arrays from Vector objects\n- Passes Matrix objects directly from the NLP\n- Manages caching to avoid redundant matrix updates\n\nMultiSolve() implementation:\n1. Check if augmented system matrices have changed (via tags)\n2. If changed, update solver_interface_ with new matrices\n3. Extract RHS vectors to raw arrays\n4. Call solver_interface_->Solve()\n5. Copy solutions back to Vector objects\n\nTag-based caching tracks:\n- W matrix and W_factor\n- Diagonal matrices D_x, D_s, D_c, D_d\n- Jacobians J_c, J_d\n- Regularization deltas\n\nInertia and quality:\n- NumberOfNegEVals(): Query solver for eigenvalue count\n- ProvidesInertia(): Check if solver supports this\n- IncreaseQuality(): Request better pivoting/tolerance",
