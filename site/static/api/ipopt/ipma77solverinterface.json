      "name": "Out-of-Core Multifrontal LDL^T Factorization:\n  MA77 uses multifrontal method with disk-based factor storage:\n  - Elimination tree computed from sparsity pattern (MC68 ordering)\n  - Frontal matrices assembled and factored sequentially\n  - Factors written to 4 disk files to minimize memory footprint\n  - Solve phase streams factors back from disk as needed\n  Enables solving problems where L factor exceeds available RAM.",
      "math": "Computes A = P\u00b7L\u00b7D\u00b7L^T\u00b7P^T where:\n  - P = permutation from MC68 (AMD/METIS fill-reducing order)\n  - L = unit lower triangular\n  - D = block diagonal (1\u00d71 and 2\u00d72 blocks for indefinite systems)\n  Inertia (positive/negative eigenvalue counts) from D block signs.",
