  "brief": "Dependency detection using symmetric linear solver\n\nTSymDependencyDetector detects linearly dependent constraint rows\nby using a TSymLinearSolver that provides degeneracy detection.\n\nMethod:\nSome symmetric linear solvers (e.g., MA57 via ProvidesDegeneracyDetection)\ncan identify dependent rows during factorization. This class\nleverages that capability.\n\nAlgorithm:\n1. Form symmetric matrix J*J^T (or equivalent structure)\n2. Attempt factorization with the TSymLinearSolver\n3. If solver detects singularity, query dependent row indices\n4. Return list of dependent rows in c_deps\n\nRequirements:\n- The underlying linear solver must implement\n  ProvidesDegeneracyDetection() returning true\n- Must implement DetermineDependentRows() for the sparse format\n\nThis is preferred over MA28-based detection when using a solver\nthat already provides this capability.",
