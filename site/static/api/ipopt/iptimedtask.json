  "brief": "Timer class for profiling algorithm components\n\nTimedTask provides RAII-style timing measurement for code blocks.\nTracks CPU time, system time, and wall clock time. Multiple\nStart()/End() pairs accumulate total time across invocations.\n\nUsage:\n  TimedTask timer;\n  timer.Start();\n  // ... expensive operation ...\n  timer.End();\n  double elapsed = timer.TotalCpuTime();\n\nUsed throughout Ipopt to report timing breakdown by category\n(function evaluation, linear solve, line search, etc.).",
