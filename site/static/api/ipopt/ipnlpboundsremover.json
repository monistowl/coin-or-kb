Remove x bounds: x now unbounded (no z_L, z_U multipliers).\n  3. Add new inequalities: d_new(x) = [d_orig(x); x].\n  4. New bounds: d_L_new = [d_L_orig; x_L], d_U_new = [d_U_orig; x_U].\n  5. Jacobian: J_d_new = [J_d_orig; I] (identity block for x bounds).\n  6. Hessian unchanged (new constraints linear in x).",
