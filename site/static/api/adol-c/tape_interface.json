      "name": "Tape-Based Operation Recording:\nADOL-C implements automatic differentiation by recording a \"tape\" of\nelementary operations during function evaluation:\n\nRECORDING PHASE (trace_on to trace_off):\n1. Each adouble gets a unique location on the tape\n2. Operations (+, -, *, /, sin, exp, etc.) record:\n   - Operation code (opcode)\n   - Input locations\n   - Output location\n   - Primal value (for reverse mode)\n3. Result: Directed acyclic graph (DAG) of operations\n\nTAPE STRUCTURE:\n- Operations buffer: sequence of opcodes\n- Locations buffer: tape indices for operands/results\n- Values buffer: constant values embedded in computation\n- Taylor buffer: intermediate values for forward/reverse\n\nTHREAD SAFETY:\nEach thread has its own tape buffer (thread_local storage).\nTapes are identified by short integer IDs (0-32767).",
