Inherit from these base classes to integrate external code\n(e.g., legacy Fortran, optimized BLAS, specialized solvers) into AD.\n\n**Classes:**\n- EDFobject: Basic external function with fixed array sizes\n- EDFobject_iArr: External function with integer array parameters\n- EDFobject_v2: Version 2 interface with variable-size arrays and context\n\n**Required overrides:**\n- function(): Evaluate the external function\n- zos_forward(): Zero-order scalar (function evaluation during taping)\n- fos_forward(): First-order scalar forward mode\n- fov_forward(): First-order vector forward mode\n- fos_reverse(): First-order scalar reverse mode\n- fov_reverse(): First-order vector reverse mode",
