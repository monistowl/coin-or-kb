  "brief": "Deterministic random number generator for HiGHS\n\nXorshift-based PRNG with strongly universal hash output functions.\n\n**State Management:**\n- 64-bit state with xorshift advance\n- initialise(): Seed with mixing to avoid weak states\n- Deterministic for reproducible optimization\n\n**Output Methods:**\n- integer(): Random in [0, 2^31-1] or [0, sup) or [min, sup)\n- fraction(): Open interval (0, 1)\n- closedFraction(): Closed interval [0, 1]\n- real(a, b): Uniform in [a, b]\n- bit(): Random boolean\n- shuffle(): Fisher-Yates shuffle\n\n**Uniform Range Algorithm:**\nUses rejection sampling with hash function outputs:\n- Multiple hash outputs per state (up to 32)\n- Minimizes state advances for bounded integers\n\n**Hash-Based Mixing:**\nApplies HighsHashHelpers::pair_hash to state for high-quality output\nin both high and low bits (unlike raw xorshift).",
