  "brief": "Row aggregation for cut generation\n\nCombines LP rows with weights to create mixed-integer Gomory source rows.\n\n**Core Operations:**\n- addRow(): Add weighted LP row to current aggregation\n- getCurrentAggregation(): Extract combined row as sparse vector\n- clear(): Reset for next aggregation\n\n**Aggregation Format:**\nResult includes slack variables making it an equation with RHS = 0:\n  sum(a_ij * x_j) + s_i = b_i  \u2192  aggregated as equality\n\n**Implementation:**\n- Uses HighsSparseVectorSum for efficient sparse combination\n- Tracks nonzero indices incrementally\n- negate parameter for sign flip (row sense conversion)\n\n**Cut Generation Context:**\n1. Start from LP tableau row (basis row)\n2. Aggregate additional rows to eliminate non-integer variables\n3. Pass to HighsTransformedLp for bound substitution\n4. Generate Gomory mixed-integer cuts",
