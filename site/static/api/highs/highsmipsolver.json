POSTSOLVE: Restore original solution space\n\nROOT NODE PROCESSING:\n  while (progress):\n    Solve LP relaxation\n    Add violated cuts (Gomory, MIR, clique, cover)\n    Run primal heuristics (diving, RINS, RENS)\n    Update bounds\n\nBRANCH-AND-BOUND TREE:\n  Initialize: dual_bound = root_LP_obj, primal_bound = +inf\n  while (open_nodes and gap > tolerance):\n    Select node (best-first, depth-first, hybrid)\n    Solve LP relaxation\n    if (LP_infeasible or LP_obj >= primal_bound):\n      Prune node\n    elif (solution is integer):\n      Update primal_bound if better\n      Prune node\n    else:\n      Add cuts if violated\n      Branch on fractional integer variable",
