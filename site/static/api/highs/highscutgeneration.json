Complement variables to ensure non-negative solution values\n2. Substitute bounds to create single-row relaxation\n3. Try CMIR (complemented MIR) with varying scale factors\n4. If integer support, try lifted knapsack cover cuts\n\n**Key Algorithms:**\n- cmirCutGenerationHeuristic(): Scale row for best MIR violation\n- separateLiftedKnapsackCover(): Knapsack cover lifting (Gu-Nemhauser-Savelsbergh)\n- separateLiftedMixedBinaryCover(): Mixed-binary cover cuts\n- separateLiftedMixedIntegerCover(): General integer cover lifting\n\n**Parameters:**\n- minEfficacy: Minimum cut violation required\n- feastol: Feasibility tolerance\n- initialScale: Starting scale factor for MIR procedure",
