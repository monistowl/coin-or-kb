      "name": "Network Path Aggregation Cuts\n\nHeuristically identifies network paths and generates flow-based cuts.\n\n**Network Path Detection:**\n1. Find rows with network structure (\u00b11 coefficients)\n2. Aggregate rows to form source-sink paths\n3. Resulting aggregation gives flow conservation cuts\n\n**Separation Heuristic:**\n- Start from fractional integer variables\n- Follow flow through network-like constraints\n- Randomized selection (HighsRandom) for diverse cuts\n\n**Cut Generation:**\n- Aggregated row passed to MIR procedure\n- Path structure often yields strong cuts\n- Effective on transportation/assignment problems",
