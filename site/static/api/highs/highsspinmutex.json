  "brief": "Lightweight spin lock for short critical sections\n\nBusy-waits instead of blocking, ideal for short-held locks.\n\n**HighsSpinMutex Class:**\nSimple test-and-set spin lock:\n- flag: Atomic bool (false = unlocked)\n- try_lock(): Non-blocking lock attempt\n- lock(): Spin until acquired\n- unlock(): Release with release semantics\n\n**Spinning Strategy:**\n- yieldProcessor(): CPU hint during spin wait\n  - x86: _mm_pause() (reduces power, prevents pipeline stalls)\n  - Others: std::this_thread::yield()\n\n**TTAS Pattern:**\nTest-and-Test-and-Set for reduced bus traffic:\n1. Exchange to try acquiring\n2. If failed, spin on load (cache-local)\n3. Only retry exchange when flag appears free\n\n**When to Use:**\nPrefer over std::mutex when critical sections are very short\nand contention is low. Avoids syscall overhead.",
