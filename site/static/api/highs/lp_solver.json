  "brief": "IPX interior point LP solver main class\n\nImplements primal-dual interior point method with crossover to basic solution.\n\n**Model Loading:**\n- LoadModel(): LP in standard form (c, lb, ub, A, rhs, constr_type)\n- LoadIPMStartingPoint(): User-provided initial point (x, xl, xu, y, zl, zu)\n\n**Solution Methods:**\n- Solve(): Run IPM + optional crossover to basis\n- CrossoverFromStartingPoint(): Convert complementary point to basis\n\n**Solution Access:**\n- GetInfo(): Solver status and statistics\n- GetInteriorSolution(): IPM iterate (primal, slack, dual)\n- GetBasicSolution(): Basic solution with basis status (vbasis, cbasis)\n\n**IPM Pipeline (InteriorPointSolve):**\n1. RunInitialIPM(): Initial centering iterations\n2. BuildStartingBasis(): Construct basis from weighted columns\n3. RunMainIPM(): Main IPM iterations with basis preconditioning\n4. RunCrossover(): Push to basis via dual/primal pushes\n\n**Key Components:**\n- control_: Parameters and logging\n- model_: Preprocessed LP data\n- iterate_: Current IPM point (x, y, z, slacks)\n- basis_: Basis for preconditioning and crossover",
