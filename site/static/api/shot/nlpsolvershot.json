  "brief": "SHOT as NLP solver for convex subproblems\n\nRecursive use of SHOT to solve fixed-integer NLP.\n\n**NLPSolverSHOT Class:**\n- Creates nested SHOT solver instance\n- Solves convex NLP after fixing integer variables\n- Useful when Ipopt is unavailable\n\n**Fixed-Integer NLP:**\n- fixVariables(): Fix discrete variables to integer values\n- solveProblemInstance(): Solve continuous subproblem\n- getSolution(): Return primal solution\n\n**Nested Architecture:**\n- Outer SHOT: Full MINLP (uses this as primal solver)\n- Inner SHOT: Convex NLP (fixed integers)\n\n@note Self-referential design for solver-agnostic NLP solving",
