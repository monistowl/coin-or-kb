  "brief": "Lazy constraint callback strategy (single-tree)\n\nCallback-based outer approximation within single B&B tree.\n\n**Algorithm Pattern:**\n1. Solve MIP with lazy constraint callback\n2. Callback checks integer solutions for feasibility\n3. Generate hyperplanes for violated constraints\n4. Add as lazy constraints, solver continues\n\n**Task Flow (initializeStrategy):**\n- CreateDualProblem \u2192 ConfigureCallback \u2192 SolveProblem\n- (cuts added via callback during solve)\n\n**Advantages:**\n- Single B&B tree exploration\n- Potentially fewer node evaluations\n- Better integration with MIP solver\n\n**Disadvantages:**\n- Requires solver callback support\n- Limited to CPLEX/Gurobi\n- More complex debugging",
