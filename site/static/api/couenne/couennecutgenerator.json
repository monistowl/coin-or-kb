  "brief": "Main convexification cut generator for global MINLP optimization\n\nGenerates linear outer approximation cuts to build convex relaxations\nof nonconvex MINLPs. Works with the symbolic CouenneProblem representation.\n\n**Cut generation (generateCuts):**\n1. For each auxiliary variable w = f(x), generate linearization cuts\n2. Cuts are based on expression type (convex envelope, secants, tangents)\n3. Uses current LP solution as linearization point\n\n**Convexification types (conv_type):**\n- Current-point linearization (most common)\n- Multi-point sampling for tighter relaxations\n\n**Cut types generated:**\n- Tangent cuts for convex functions\n- Secant cuts for concave functions\n- McCormick envelope cuts for bilinear terms\n- Specialized cuts for sin, cos, exp, log, etc.\n\n**Helper methods:**\n- addEnvelope(): Generate convex/concave envelope for univariate function\n- addSegment(): Add secant line between two points\n- addTangent(): Add tangent at given point\n- createCut(): Build and validate OsiRowCut",
