  "brief": "Floor function w = floor(x)\n\nReturns the largest integer not exceeding x. Piecewise constant\nfunction with jump discontinuities at each integer.\n\n**Convexification challenge:**\nfloor(x) is neither convex nor concave nor continuous. The function\nis constant on intervals [n, n+1) with value n.\n\n**Bound propagation:**\n- lb(w) = floor(lb(x))\n- ub(w) = floor(ub(x))\n\n**Integrality:**\nResult is always integer-valued, even when argument is continuous.\nThis can introduce implicit integrality constraints.\n\n**Not cuttable:**\nNo convex relaxation exists for piecewise constant functions.\nMust rely on branching to handle.",
