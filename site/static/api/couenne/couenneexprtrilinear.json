Direct trilinear relaxation\n\n**Convexification:**\nUses direct trilinear relaxation when available, which can\nprovide tighter bounds than cascaded bilinear products.\nGenerates 8 linear constraints forming a polyhedral relaxation.\n\n**Implied bounds:**\nGiven w in [wl,wu] and bounds on x,y,z, tightens bounds\nby considering all 8 corners of the 3D box.",
