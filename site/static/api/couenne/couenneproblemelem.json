  "brief": "Constraint and objective classes for Couenne problems\n\nDefines the building blocks for optimization problems:\nconstraints with expression bounds and objective functions.\n\n**CouenneConstraint:**\nRepresents lb_ <= body_ <= ub_ where all three are expressions:\n- body_: The constraint expression (e.g., exp(x1+x2))\n- lb_: Lower bound expression (defaults to 0 or -INFINITY)\n- ub_: Upper bound expression (defaults to 0 or +INFINITY)\n\n**Default bound handling:**\n- Both NULL \u2192 equality constraint (lb = ub = 0)\n- lb NULL, ub set \u2192 lb = -INFINITY (one-sided upper)\n- ub NULL, lb set \u2192 ub = +INFINITY (one-sided lower)\n\n**CouenneObjective:**\nMinimization objective wrapper. Maximization problems are\nconverted by negating the objective during problem input.\n\n**standardize():**\nDecomposes complex expressions into auxiliary variable\ndefinitions for reformulation-linearization.",
