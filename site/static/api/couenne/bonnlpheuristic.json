Check if current LP solution is nearly MINLP-feasible\n2. Round integer variables to nearest integer\n3. Call Ipopt to find local NLP solution\n4. If feasible, return as candidate incumbent\n\n**Comparison to FeasibilityPump:**\n- FeasPump: Alternates MILP/NLP from any point\n- NlpHeuristic: Only triggers when already near-feasible",
