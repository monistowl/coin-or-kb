      "name": "Variable-Based Branching for Global Optimization\n\nBranching object that focuses on original problem variables rather\nthan auxiliary variables. Computes infeasibility by aggregating\nacross all auxiliaries that depend on this variable.\n\n**Infeasibility computation:**\nFor variable x, sum/min/max over all auxiliaries w = f(...,x,...)\nthe violation |w - f(...,x,...)|. This captures how much branching\non x could help close all related gaps.\n\n**Variable selection modes:**\n- OSI_SIMPLE: Use LP solution value directly\n- OSI_STRONG: Use strong branching estimate\n\n**Branch creation:**\nCan create either:\n- CouenneBranchingObject: standard two-way branch\n- CouenneThreeWayBranchObj: three-way spatial branch\n\n**isCuttable():**\nReturns whether we're on the \"bad\" side where cuts would help.\nIf not cuttable, branching is more likely to help.",
