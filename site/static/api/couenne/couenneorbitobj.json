      "name": "Orbital Branching via Nauty Symmetry Detection\n\nNOTE: This code is currently commented out/disabled.\n\nImplements orbital branching which exploits problem symmetry to\nreduce the search space. Uses nauty library to detect symmetries\nand organize variables into orbits.\n\n**Orbital branching concept:**\nIf variables {x1, x2, x3} are symmetric (permutable without\nchanging the problem), then branching on any one of them is\nequivalent. The orbit {x1, x2, x3} can be treated as a single\nbranching decision, pruning symmetric subtrees.\n\n**Node class:**\nStores variable metadata for symmetry detection:\n- index: variable index\n- coeff, lb, ub: bounds and coefficients\n- color: vertex coloring for nauty\n\n**Integration with nauty:**\n- Compute_Symmetry(): Calls nauty to find automorphisms\n- Print_Orbits(): Display detected orbits\n- ChangeBounds(): Update bounds respecting symmetry",
