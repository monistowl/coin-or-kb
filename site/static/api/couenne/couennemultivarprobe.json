Can detect\nimplications that single-variable probing would miss.\n\n**Multi-variable probing:**\nInstead of fixing one variable at a time, considers combinations\nof variable settings to derive stronger implied bounds.\n\n**Example:**\nSingle-variable probing on x1 and x2 separately might not tighten bounds,\nbut probing x1=lb AND x2=ub together might prove infeasibility or\nderive new bounds.\n\n**Parameters:**\n- maxTime_: Maximum time for probing\n- numCols_: Number of columns to consider",
