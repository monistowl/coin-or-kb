  "brief": "ALPS node descriptor storing branching bounds\n\nAlpsDecompNodeDesc derives from AlpsNodeDesc to store the\ndescription of a tree node for serialization and reconstruction.\n\n**Storage:**\nDIP doesn't use full differencing (delta encoding), so node\ndescriptions primarily store bound changes from branching:\n- Variable lower/upper bound modifications\n- Warm start basis (optional)\n\n**Key Methods:**\n- encode(): Serialize to AlpsEncoded for transmission\n- decode(): Reconstruct from encoded form\n\n**ALPS Integration:**\n- Each AlpsDecompTreeNode has an AlpsDecompNodeDesc\n- Used for checkpointing and parallel distribution\n- Compact representation for tree storage",
