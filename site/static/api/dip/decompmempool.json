  "brief": "Pre-allocated memory arrays for performance\n\nDecompMemPool provides reusable scratch arrays to avoid repeated\nallocations during the inner loops of the algorithm.\n\n**Pre-allocated Arrays:**\n- dblArrNCoreCols: Double array sized for core columns\n- dblArrNCoreRows: Double array sized for core rows\n\n**Usage:**\nRather than allocating temporary arrays in hot paths like\nreduced cost calculation or constraint evaluation, use these\npre-allocated buffers for better cache performance.\n\n**Memory Management:**\n- allocateMemory(): Size arrays based on problem dimensions\n- Destructor frees all allocated memory\n- Single allocation at algorithm start",
