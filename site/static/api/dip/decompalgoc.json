      "name": "Cutting Plane Method (CPM):\nIteratively tighten LP relaxation with valid inequalities.\n\nALGORITHM:\n  1. Solve LP relaxation: min c'x s.t. Ax \u2265 b\n  2. if x* is integer-feasible: STOP (optimal)\n  3. Search for violated cut: a'x \u2265 \u03b2 with a'x* < \u03b2\n  4. if cut found: add to LP, goto 1\n  5. else: BRANCH on fractional variable\n\nMASTER PROBLEM STRUCTURE:\n  Original variables x (not Dantzig-Wolfe lambdas)\n  Rows grow as cuts are added\n  Columns remain fixed",
      "math": "Convergence for polyhedra:\n  If conv(X) = {x : Ax \u2265 b} (LP = IP), CPM finds optimum.\n  In general, CPM finds optimum over intersection of\n  LP relaxation with all generated cuts.\n\nWHEN TO USE:\n- LP relaxation is naturally strong\n- No obvious block structure for decomposition\n- Want simplicity over Dantzig-Wolfe",
