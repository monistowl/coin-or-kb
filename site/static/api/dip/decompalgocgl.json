  "brief": "Interface to CGL (COIN-OR Cut Generation Library)\n\nDecompAlgoCGL wraps CGL cut generators for use in DIP algorithms.\nProvides automatic generation of standard MIP cuts.\n\n**Available CGL Generators:**\n- CglClique: Clique cuts from conflict graph\n- CglOddHole: Odd hole inequalities\n- CglFlowCover: Flow cover cuts\n- CglKnapsackCover: Knapsack cover cuts\n- CglMixedIntegerRounding2: MIR cuts\n- CglGomory: Gomory mixed-integer cuts\n\n**Usage:**\n- Created by DecompAlgo during initialization\n- Called during PHASE_CUT to generate cuts\n- Returns cuts via DecompCutOsi wrapper\n\n**Configuration:**\n- Generators enabled/disabled via DecompParam\n- Per-generator parameters can be set\n- Different strategies for PC vs C algorithms\n\n**Integration:**\nCGL generates cuts in x-space. For Price-and-Cut, these are\nreformulated to lambda-space before adding to master.",
