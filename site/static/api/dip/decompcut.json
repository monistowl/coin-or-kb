  "brief": "Cut representation in original x-space\n\nDecompCut represents a cutting plane (valid inequality) that can be\nadded to strengthen the formulation. Cuts are defined in original\nx-space and expanded to the master problem.",

    {
      "name": "Duplicate Detection via Hash:\nAvoid adding same cut multiple times.\n\n  m_strHash = string encoding of (indices, coeffs, sense, rhs)\n  setStringHash(): Called after expandCutToRow()\n  Comparison: O(1) hash equality check",
      "math": "Why remove ineffective cuts:\n  - Slack cuts don't affect LP solution\n  - Large LPs slow down simplex iterations\n  - Memory overhead for storing coefficients\n  - Better to add fresh violated cuts",
