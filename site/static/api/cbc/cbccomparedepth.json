      "math": "Complexity trade-off:\n  DFS memory: O(d) where d = tree depth.\n  Best-first memory: O(2^d) worst case.\n  DFS bound gap: May be large until substantial backtracking.\n  Best-first bound: Optimal LP bound tracked throughout.\n\nAdvantages:\n- Low memory (linear in depth)\n- Fast to first feasible solution\n- Good for proving feasibility\n\nDisadvantages:\n- May miss better solutions at other branches\n- Weak objective bounds early in search",
