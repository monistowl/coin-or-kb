Select node from priority queue (best-first or depth-first)\n     b. Solve LP relaxation, apply cuts (Gomory, MIR, clique, etc.)\n     c. If fractional: branch on integer variable, create child nodes\n     d. If integer-feasible: update incumbent if improved\n     e. Prune by bound if LP \u2265 incumbent\n  3.
