For each: attempt simplex pivot to move to adjacent BFS.\n  3. After pivots, fix integers at current (hopefully integral) values.\n  4. Re-optimize continuous variables and check feasibility.\n  Exploits LP degeneracy for alternate basic solutions.",
      "math": "Simplex neighborhood exploration:\n  Adjacent basic feasible solutions differ by one exchange.\n  Pivot: x_B[i] leaves basis, x_N[j] enters (maintaining feasibility).\n  May reach integer-feasible BFS via sequence of degenerate pivots.\n  Effective when LP has many alternate optima.\n\nUses the LP optimal basis and pivots to find integer-feasible\nsolutions nearby in the simplex sense.",
