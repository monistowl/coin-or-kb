      "math": "Optimality proof efficiency:\n  Best-first guarantees: global_bound = min{LP(node) : node open}.\n  Gap = (incumbent - global_bound) / |incumbent|.\n  Minimizes gap at each step \u2192 optimal for gap closure.\n  Memory: May store O(2^d) nodes; gap improves slowly until near proof.\n\nAdvantages:\n- Optimal search order for proving optimality\n- Best global bound progression\n- Minimizes total nodes for proof (in theory)\n\nDisadvantages:\n- Can use exponential memory\n- May take long to find first feasible solution\n- Poor anytime behavior",
