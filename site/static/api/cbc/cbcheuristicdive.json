While fractional variables exist:\n     a. selectVariableToBranch() \u2192 bestColumn, bestRound.\n     b. Fix x[bestColumn] in direction bestRound.\n     c. Re-solve LP; if infeasible, backtrack or fail.\n  3. If integer feasible: Return solution.\n  4. Apply reduced cost fixing during dive for speedup.",
