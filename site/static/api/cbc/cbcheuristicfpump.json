While x* \u2260 x\u0304 and iterations < max:\n   a. x* \u2190 argmin ||x - x\u0304|| s.t. Ax = b, l \u2264 x \u2264 u (LP toward x\u0304)\n   b. x\u0304 \u2190 round(x*)\n4. If x* = x\u0304, return feasible solution\n\nEnhancements:\n- Objective blending: min \u03b1\u00b7c^Tx + (1-\u03b1)\u00b7||x-x\u0304|| trades feasibility vs quality\n- Cycle detection: Track visited roundings, perturb if cycling\n- Randomization: Random flips to escape local minima\n- General integers: Auxiliary binary formulation or specialized rounding",
