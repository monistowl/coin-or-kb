Implements state-dependent bound changes\nthat go beyond LP propagation.\n\nState encoding:\n- -9999: Variable at lower bound\n- +9999: Variable at upper bound\n- Other: Variable fixed to that specific value\n\nFor each state, stores arrays of:\n- Variables to modify (variable_)\n- New bounds to apply (newBound_)\n- Ranges for lower vs upper bound changes (startLower_, startUpper_)\n\nExample: Binary y controls continuous x. When y=0 (state -9999),\nfix x to 0; when y=1 (state +9999), x can be in [0, 100].",
