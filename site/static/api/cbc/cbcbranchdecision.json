Select k candidates (most fractional or pseudocost-based)\n2. For each candidate, solve LP for both branches (with iteration limit)\n3. Record D\u207a_j = z\u207a_j - z, D\u207b_j = z\u207b_j - z (or infeasible/cutoff)\n4. Score candidates, pick best\n5. Update pseudo-costs from observed degradations",
