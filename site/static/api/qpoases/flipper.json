Store R, Q, T factorizations in Flipper\n      2. Store working set (Bounds, Constraints)\n      3. Attempt active set change\n      4. If numerical trouble: restore from Flipper\n\n  STORAGE:\n    - R_: Cholesky factor of reduced Hessian\n    - Q_: Orthogonal factor\n    - T_: Schur complement factor (for constraints)\n    - bounds_/constraints_: working set snapshot\n\n  USE CASE:\n    Online QP in MPC: parameters change between solves\n    Hot-starting may flip bounds, needing recovery option",
