This is common in:\n- Nonlinear MPC (linearization changes each step)\n- Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) for NLP\n- Moving horizon estimation",

Update factorization of reduced Hessian Z'HZ\n2. Recompute KKT system factors with new matrices\n3. Use W* as initial working set (likely still optimal or close)\n4. Apply standard active-set iterations if needed\n\nMATRIX UPDATE STRATEGY:\n- Small changes: Rank-k updates to existing factorization\n- Large changes: Full refactorization (still faster than cold start)\n- Sparse matrices: Use SQProblemSchur for Schur complement approach\n\nSQP APPLICATION:\nFor min f(x) s.t. c(x)=0, g(x)\u22640:\n  At iterate x\u2096, solve QP subproblem:\n  min \u2207f'p + \u00bdp'\u2207\u00b2Lp  s.t. \u2207c'p + c = 0, \u2207g'p + g \u2264 0\n  where L is Lagrangian, H = \u2207\u00b2L changes each iteration",
