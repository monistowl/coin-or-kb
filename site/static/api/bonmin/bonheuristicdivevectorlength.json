Variable selection based on column\nlength (number of constraints containing the variable).\n\n**Rationale:** Variables appearing in many constraints have higher\nimpact when fixed. By weighting fractionality by column length,\nwe prioritize fixing variables that propagate more information.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n1. Precompute columnLength_j for all integer variables\n2. For each fractional x_j, compute score = min(f_j, 1-f_j) \u00b7 columnLength_j\n3. Select j* = argmax_j score(x_j)\n4. Round towards nearest integer",
