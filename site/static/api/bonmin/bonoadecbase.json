  "brief": "Base class for Outer Approximation (OA) decomposition algorithms\n\nImplements the foundation for OA-based MINLP algorithms. OA iterates between\nsolving MILP subproblems and NLP subproblems, generating linear outer\napproximations of the nonlinear constraints.\n\n**OA algorithm outline:**\n1. Solve MILP relaxation \u2192 get integer solution x*\n2. Fix integers to x*, solve NLP \u2192 get nonlinear solution y*\n3. Generate linearization cuts at y* (gradient-based)\n4. Add cuts to MILP, repeat until convergence\n\n**Key components:**\n- solverManip: RAII helper to save/restore solver state\n- performOa(): Virtual method implementing specific OA variant\n- post_nlp_solve(): Handle NLP solution and update bounds\n\n**Parameters:**\n- global_: Add cuts globally (valid at all nodes)\n- addOnlyViolated_: Only add cuts violated by current solution\n- maxLocalSearch_: Limit on local search iterations",

Subproblem is NLP\nwith integers fixed. Iterate until master and sub agree.\n\nKey insight: For convex MINLP, linearization at any feasible point\nprovides valid outer approximation. Accumulating cuts from multiple\nNLP solves progressively tightens the MILP approximation.",
