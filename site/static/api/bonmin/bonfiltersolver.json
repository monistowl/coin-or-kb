FilterSQP uses sequential quadratic\nprogramming with a filter-based trust region.\n\n**Key features:**\n- OptimizeTNLP()/ReOptimizeTNLP(): Solve NLPs via FilterSQP\n- cachedInfo: Caches problem structure for efficient re-optimization\n- TMat2RowPMat(): Converts sparse matrix formats for Fortran interface\n\n**Filter algorithm:**\nThe \"filter\" maintains pairs (constraint violation, objective value) and\naccepts steps that improve either measure - more robust than merit functions.",
