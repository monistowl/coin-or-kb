Ax \u2264 b, x_j \u2208 Z (integer vars)\n      MIP solution suggests which integers to fix and their values.\n\nHeuristicDiveMIP: Abstract base class for diving heuristics that solve\nMIP subproblems during the dive. Unlike pure NLP-based diving, this\nuses a SubMipSolver (mip_) to handle integer feasibility more robustly.\n\n**Key advantage over NLP diving:**\n- MIP solver handles combinatorial structure better\n- Can find feasible integer assignments that NLP diving misses\n- Useful when NLP relaxation is far from integer feasible\n\n**Trade-off:** More expensive per iteration (MIP solve vs O(n) selection)\nbut may require fewer total iterations.\n\nDerived classes implement:\n- setInternalVariables(): Setup for variable selection\n- selectVariableToBranch(): Variable and rounding direction choice",
