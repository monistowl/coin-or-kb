Modify bounds: x_i \u2265 \u2308x_i\u2309 (up) or x_i \u2264 \u230ax_i\u230b (down)\n   b. solveFromHotStart():\n      - Warm start LP from stored basis\n      - Run ECP iterations (up to maxCuttingPlaneIterations_)\n      - Record objective change \u0394obj_i\n3. unmarkHotStart(): Restore original bounds, clean up\n4. Select: i* = argmax{score(\u0394obj_i\u207a, \u0394obj_i\u207b)}\n\nWarm start modes:\n- Basis: Reuse LP basis (faster, less accurate)\n- Clone: Clone entire LP solver (slower, more accurate)",
