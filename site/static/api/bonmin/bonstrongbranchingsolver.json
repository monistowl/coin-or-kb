Supports hot-start capability to reuse factorizations.\n\n**Hot-start protocol:**\n1. markHotStart(): Save current solver state before branching evaluations\n2. solveFromHotStart(): Solve with changed bounds (fast, reuses state)\n3. unmarkHotStart(): Restore original state after all evaluations\n\n**Implementations:**\n- LpBranchingSolver: LP-based strong branching\n- QpBranchingSolver: QP approximation for strong branching\n- CurvBranchingSolver: Curvature-based branching",
