Extends the MIP Feasibility Pump to handle nonlinear\nconstraints by using NLP subproblem solves.\n\nAlternates between:\n- Rounding current NLP solution to integer\n- Solving NLP with objective minimizing distance to rounded point\n\nAuthors: Pierre Bonami, LIF Universit\u00e9 de la M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e-CNRS\nDate: 02/18/2009",
