      "name": "NLP-Based OsiSolverInterface with Outer Approximation\n\nProvides an OsiSolverInterface that wraps a TMINLP problem, enabling\nBonmin to use Cbc's branch-and-bound framework. The continuous relaxations\nare solved by an NLP solver (Ipopt or FilterSQP) rather than LP.\n\n**Key functionality:**\n- initialSolve()/resolve(): Solve NLP relaxation via TNLPSolver\n- extractLinearRelaxation(): Build LP outer approximation (OA)\n- getOuterApproximation(): Generate OA cuts at current point\n- solveFeasibilityProblem(): Find nearest feasible point\n\n**Outer Approximation (OA) support:**\n- Linearizes nonlinear constraints at solution points\n- Generates cutting planes for MIP approximation\n- Enables hybrid NLP-BB / OA-BB algorithms\n\n**Warm starting:**\n- Supports warm starts from previous NLP solutions\n- Multiple retry strategies for failed NLP solves\n\n@note Many OsiSolverInterface methods throw since an NLP lacks an LP matrix",
