      "name": "MINLP\u2192NLP Adapter for B&B Node Processing\n\nThis adapter pattern allows an external caller to modify variable bounds,\nenabling treatment of binary/integer variables as either relaxed (continuous)\nor fixed. Essential for branch-and-bound where each node fixes or bounds\ninteger variables differently.\n\n**Key functionality:**\n- SetVariableBounds(): Modify bounds for branching\n- SetVariableType(): Change variable types (for probing/fixing)\n- x_sol()/duals_sol(): Access solution after optimization\n- get_starting_point(): Provide initial/warm start point\n\n**Usage in B&B:**\n1. Root node: All integers relaxed to continuous\n2. Branching: Fix or bound integer variables\n3. Each node: Solve NLP relaxation via Ipopt\n4. Warm start: Use parent's solution for faster convergence",
