Inherits from both\nCoinWarmStartPrimalDual and CoinWarmStartBasis for Cbc compatibility.\n\n**Data stored:**\n- x: Primal variables (from CoinWarmStartPrimalDual)\n- lam: Dual multipliers (from CoinWarmStartPrimalDual)\n- lws: FilterSQP's integer working set array (active set info)\n- istat[14]: FilterSQP status array\n\n**Classes:**\n- FilterWarmStart: Main warm start container\n- FilterWarmStartDiff: Differential update for tree traversal",
