Inherits from both CoinWarmStartPrimalDual (for actual data) and\nCoinWarmStartBasis (for Cbc integration compatibility).\n\n**Data layout (dual part has 2*n + m values):**\n- [0, n): Dual multipliers for lower bounds (z_L for x >= l)\n- [n, 2n): Dual multipliers for upper bounds (z_U for x <= u)\n- [2n, 2n+m): Dual multipliers for constraints (lambda for g(x))\n\n**Classes:**\n- IpoptWarmStart: Main warm start container\n- IpoptWarmStartDiff: Differential update for tree traversal",
