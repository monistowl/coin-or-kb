      "math": "Combines MIP guidance with fractional selection:\n      1. Solve MIP subproblem to get candidate integer assignment\n      2. Among unfixed variables, select j* = argmax min(f_j, 1-f_j)\n      3. Rounding uses MIP solution when available, else nearest integer\n\nHeuristicDiveMIPFractional: Diving heuristic for MINLP that solves\nMIP subproblems during diving. Variable selection based on\nfractionality - picks variable closest to 0.5.\n\n**Hybrid approach:** Uses MIP solver's insight into integer feasibility\ncombined with simple fractional selection. More robust than pure NLP\ndiving when MIP relaxation provides good guidance.",
