Formulate normalization: ||cut|| = 1 (various norms)\n  2. For each disjunction term, lift the LP relaxation\n  3. Find cut valid for intersection of lifted polyhedra\n  4. Project cut back to original variable space\n\n  This class optimizes the CGLP by pivoting through adjacent bases,\n  seeking the most violated intersection cut.",
