  "brief": "Knapsack cover cuts for binary packing constraints\n\nGenerates cover inequalities for knapsack constraints of the form\nsum_j a_j * x_j <= b where x_j are binary. A cover C is a subset\nwhere sum_{j in C} a_j > b, making x_j = 1 for all j in C infeasible.\n\nCover inequality: sum_{j in C} x_j <= |C| - 1\n\nAlgorithm phases:\n1. deriveAKnapsack(): Convert constraint to canonical binary knapsack\n2. Find minimal violated cover using:\n   - findExactMostViolatedMinCover(): Exact via Horowitz-Sahni\n   - findLPMostViolatedMinCover(): LP relaxation heuristic\n   - findGreedyCover(): Simple greedy heuristic\n3. Lifting: Strengthen cover to full-dimensional inequality\n   - liftCoverCut(): Sequence-independent lifting\n   - seqLiftAndUncomplementAndAdd(): Sequence-dependent lifting\n   - liftUpDownAndUncomplementAndAdd(): Up/down lifting for binaries\n\nAdditional features:\n- createCliques(): Build clique structure for probing\n- Horowitz-Sahni algorithm for exact knapsack solving\n- John-Ellis cover finding from OSL (IBM's solver)\n\nKey parameters:\n- maxInKnapsack_: Maximum variables in processed knapsack\n- expensiveCuts_: Enable/disable costly exact methods\n- rowsToCheck_: Restrict which rows to examine",
