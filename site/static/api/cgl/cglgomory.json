  "brief": "Gomory mixed-integer cuts from optimal LP basis\n\nGenerates Gomory fractional cuts, the classic MIP cutting planes\nderived by Ralph Gomory in the 1950s-60s. For each fractional basic\nvariable, derives a valid inequality from the simplex tableau row.\n\nAlgorithm:\n1. Requires optimal LP basis (needsOptimalBasis() = true)\n2. For each basic integer variable with fractional value:\n   - Get tableau row: x_i + sum_j a_ij * x_j = b_i\n   - Apply fractional parts: sum_j f(a_ij)*x_j >= f(b_i)\n   - For mixed-integer: separate continuous/integer coefficients\n3. Strengthen using integrality of non-basic integers\n\nKey parameters:\n- limit_/limitAtRoot_: Max nonzeros in cut (dense cuts are expensive)\n- away_/awayAtRoot_: Min distance from integrality to generate cut\n- conditionNumberMultiplier_: Relax cut if basis is ill-conditioned\n- gomoryType_: 0=normal, 1=add original, 2=replace with original matrix\n\nNumerical considerations:\n- Basis condition number affects cut reliability\n- largestFactorMultiplier_ controls cut relaxation for stability\n- alternateFactorization_ uses different factorization for accuracy\n\nGomory cuts are finite and can solve pure integer programs in theory,\nbut numerically fragile. Modern solvers combine with other cuts.",
