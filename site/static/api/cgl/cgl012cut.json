      "name": "{0,1/2}-Cuts (Zero-Half Cuts):\nDerive cuts from mod-2 combinations of constraint rows.\n\nDERIVATION:\n  Given inequalities a_i'x <= b_i with a_i integer:\n  Take subset S with |S| odd\n  Sum: (sum_{i in S} a_i)'x <= sum_{i in S} b_i\n  Divide by 2: (1/2)(sum a_i)'x <= (1/2)(sum b_i)\n  Round down RHS: (1/2)(sum a_i)'x <= floor((1/2)(sum b_i))\n\n  The rounding is valid because LHS is half-integral.\n\nSEPARATION PROBLEM:\n  Find S such that the derived cut is violated by current LP solution x*.\n  Violation = (1/2)(sum_{i in S} a_i)'x* - floor((1/2)(sum_{i in S} b_i))\n\nMOD-2 FORMULATION:\n  Work in GF(2) (binary field):\n  - Coefficients: a_ij mod 2\n  - RHS: b_i mod 2\n  - Find odd cycle in auxiliary graph\n\nAUXILIARY GRAPH:\n  Node for each row, edge weight = slack contribution\n  Find shortest odd cycle = most violated cut\n\nCAPRARA-FISCHETTI ALGORITHM:\n  1. Build parity matrix (mod-2)\n  2. Construct separation graph\n  3. Find shortest paths between node pairs\n  4. Combine paths to form odd cycles\n  5. Extract violated cuts from cycles",
