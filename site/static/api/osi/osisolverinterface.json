  "brief": "Abstract base class defining the Open Solver Interface (OSI)\n\nOSI provides a uniform API for accessing different LP/MIP solvers\n(Clp, CPLEX, Gurobi, GLPK, etc.) through a common interface. This\nallows solver-independent application code.\n\nKey capabilities:\n- LP relaxation solving (initialSolve, resolve)\n- Model query (getColLower, getRowUpper, getObjCoefficients)\n- Solution query (getColSolution, getRowPrice, getReducedCost)\n- Problem modification (setColBounds, addRow, addCol)\n- Warm starting (getWarmStart, setWarmStart)\n- Cut management (applyCuts, applyRowCuts)\n- MIP support (setInteger, branchAndBound)\n\nTypical workflow:\n1. Create solver-specific instance (e.g., OsiClpSolverInterface)\n2. Load problem via loadProblem() or readMps()\n3. Call initialSolve() for first LP solution\n4. Call resolve() after modifications\n5. Query solution via getColSolution(), getObjValue()",

      "name": "Design Pattern: Abstract Factory + Strategy\n  - Factory: concrete implementations (OsiClpSolverInterface, etc.)\n    instantiate solver-specific backends\n  - Strategy: algorithm choice (simplex vs barrier) delegated to\n    underlying solver; OSI provides uniform control interface\n  - Bridge: decouples client code from solver implementation details\n\n@invariant Solution pointers (getColSolution, getRowPrice, etc.) are\n  invalidated by any problem modification or subsequent solve call.\n  Client code must copy data if needed across modifications.\n\n@invariant Warm start objects must be compatible with the solver that\n  created them. Cross-solver warm starting requires basis translation.",
